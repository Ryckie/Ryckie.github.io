## DEFR VCA - bot information

I provide the voice channel announcments.
To hear them, you must have the defined text channel open.
Usually this will be set to a text channel in the same category
as the voice channel you are conected to.

**General Commands:**
`dvca!help` - shows the help page.
`dvca!ping` - shows bot response time (ms).
`dvca!invite` - Invite this bot to your own server.

**Setup Commands** *(administrator only)*
`dvca!link` - link this text-channel to the voice-channel you are connected to.
`dvca!unlink` - unlink the text-channel from the voice-channel you're conected to.
`dvca!reset` - [SOON TO BE ADDED] Resets all the settings made.



Note: All setup commands are restricted to `administrators` only.
I need the following permissions: change nickname, read messages, send messages, send tts messages, add reactions, use external emoji's and view channels to work properly.
